# GlobalGameJam2017-PartyBeasts
Game Developed in 48 hours at Global Game Jam 2017.

A two player game where animals and humans wave at each other at a birthday party. Yeah, we don't really know either. Player one uses the 'A' key, and player two uses the 'L' key. The goal is to reach a number of button mashes before the other player without going over the number. It's a button masher!
